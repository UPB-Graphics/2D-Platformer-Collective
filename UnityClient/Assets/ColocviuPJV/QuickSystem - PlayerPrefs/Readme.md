`PlayerPrefs` is a class that stores Player preferences between game sessions. It can store string, float and integer values into the userâ€™s platform registry.

A quick and easy way to implement a save system is to use Unity's built in PlayerPrefs class.
It is recommended for saving preferences/settings such video, audio, etc. However, if you only care about saving a few values, such as max score or a player's position (for example in a game such as Flappy Bird), this system can work fine. 

If too many entities' properties need to be saved, then a more robust system is needed in order to abstract these operations.  


- Player_v2.cs makes use of the JsonUtility class to serialize a property such as 'transform.position' and save that using PlayerPrefs rather then saving each individual component of transform.position(x,y,z)
